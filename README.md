## Overview
This application is a basic drum loop machine created with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The user uses the application by interacting with the various squares on the screen, representing each instrument and an 8-beat track.

Be aware: any files in the audio folder aren't loading into sources. The project works fine on my home computer, but unsure as to why there's this trouble with the pages.
